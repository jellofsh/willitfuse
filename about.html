    Hi! I am a student at the University of Michigan, and I love to cook! Growing up, I've never liked to stick to a single flavor palette, so combining foods only seemed natural. Sharing food is and always has been a way of showing trust, hospitality, and friendship. So, it is my goal to unite different people and different cultures through the one thing we can all share and love.
