    <h1>Orange Cardamom Ice Cream</h1>

  <p id = 'intro'>
    Who screams for ice cream? I scream for ICE CREAM!!! This frozen treat has been an important part of my family's traditions for generations, but so has creativity. 
    So I wanted to create a flavor of ice cream that I had never seen in a store. This dessert was designed to pair perfectly with a flavorful and fragrant main dish and is 
    will end the meal with a pop of spice!

  <h4> Orange: </h4>
  <p id = 'orange'>
    Citrus fruits are native to Southeast Asia, but they have spread across the globe and become a favorite flavor of many different cuisines. 
    Early on, they were spread through trade routes and army campaigns. They were likely brought to the Roman Empire by Persian traders and easily spread 
    throughout the empire under a unified rule. The Islamic empires continued Persian and Byzantine culinary traditions which included citrus flavors after 
    the decline of Rome. Here, the whole plant was used, from the leaves to the juice. Today, Brazil is the largest producer of oranges globally, and many new varieties 
    have become popular since the first oranges were used.

  <h4> Cardamom: </h4>
  <p id = 'cardamom'>
    Originating in southern India, cardamom has found its place as an important traditional spice in Arab, Iranian, and North African cuisines as it was spread along trade 
    routes in ancient times. It is such an ancient spice, its use dates back at least 4,000 years! In ancient Egypt, cardamom was used as a medicine and in embalming, before it was 
    ever prized as a culinary flavoring. Interestingly enough, cardamom has also found prominence in Scandinavia, far from its origins and any well-established trade routes of the 
    ancient world. One of the earliest cookbooks recovered from medieval Scandinavia contains the first mention of cardamom in this region and includes many recipes identical to Moorish ones. 
    This is why some believe that the Moors, after establishing a presence on the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century CE, spread the beloved spice to the north.
