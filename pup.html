            I'd have to say there is no meal closer to my heart than warm, classic Northern Michigan pasties. The secrets to the perfect flaky pie dough were lovingly 
            shared with me by my grandmother during the many summers I spent with her. There are a few dishes which she can undoubtedly prepare better than anyone else, 
            and one of those is pie of any flavor or form. Sometimes I wonder if I should be sharing our family secret, but I believe everyone should be able to taste something 
            as wonderful as my grandmother's good old American cooking!

            Pasties are known as an all-around efficient and convenient meal. Being introduced to Michigan in the 1840s, Cornish pasties quickly became a staple in the 
            mining communities in the north. While workers were hacking away in the copper mines, pasties offered a compact, portable, and nutrient rich lunch to keep them going 
            strong. The "pot pies without a pot" are traditionally stuffed with a roast (shredded into more manageable pieces), carrots, potatoes, or other healthy vegetables.

            Barbeque itself is a fusion of different cuisines. It combines traditional flavors of Southeastern Indian, West African, and West European cooking to create a 
            southern American staple. A lot of the traditions associated with BBQ sauce likely originated from African cooking. When millions of Africans were enslaved and brought 
            to the Americas in the 16th to 19th centuries, they brought their flavors with them. Their cooking favored tart, spicy, and flavorful foods, including the use of lemon 
            and lime juice to flavor meats. By 1698, West Indian cooks were using lime juice and hot peppers to flavor their barbecued meats, as witnessed by the Dominican missionary 
            PÃ¨re Labat. Vinegar became the staple BBQ sauce base in the South around the 1800s, and is still one of the most popular preparations today. Tomato-based sauces, the most 
            widely-known today, did not become common until the early 20th century. There are infinitely many different ways to prepare barbecue sauce, so get creative!
